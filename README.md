# Traffic Light Simulator
This is a reinforcement learning project that simulates traffic lights in an intersection. The goal of the project is to optimize the timing of traffic lights to reduce congestion and improve traffic flow using reinforcement learning techniques and comparing it to other, more conventional methods.


## Methods
3 traffic light controlling algorithims have been implemnted, These are:
- Reinforcement Learning: Q learning algorithim
- Round Robin: circulates the light in a counter clockwise rotation
- Greedy Algorithm: always services the direction with the highest load
